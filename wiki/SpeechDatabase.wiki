#summary Speed up reading of Speech units

Currently all the speech files and related information  are stored on flat file system. Accessing it and searching for the required data is taking a lot of time which has resulted in low efficiency. Moving these into a Relational/XML database might improve the speed and would definitely simplify code. Need to explore this. Preferred databases to be used: MySQL, Apache Derby.

ToDo:
* Explore the best approach to be used - RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems)/ XML/LDAP? Derby/MySQL? etc.
* Design the database/XML schema.
* Modify the source code.
